 Description   : This program uses the IntergerList and Die classes to simulate rolling
 two dice an many times as the user wants and then finding the largest run of consecutive
 rolls of 2 (i.e. snake eyes).
 User Interface: The program will ask the user for the number of rolls to do in the simulation.
